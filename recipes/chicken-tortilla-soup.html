    <h3>Hearty Soup to Make all your Troubles go Away</h3>
        <p>
            If you're a beginner trying to work your way around the kitchen, you can never go wrong
            with recreating a chicken soup recipe. Not this isn't just your ordinary chicken soup that
            can be cooked and served within 30 minutes. Though the prep time is about 30 minutes, the chicken broth will be made from scratch!
            If you're not up for the challenge yet, I recommend trying this recipe
            <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-tortilla-soup-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>here.</strong></a>

            <p> The soup is a little on the spicy side, topped with garnishes such as:
            <ul>
                <li>tortilla chips</li>
                <li>sour cream</li>
                <li>cliantro <em>(if the soapy taste doesn't bother you)</em></li>
                <li>crumbled Mexican cheese</li>
            </ul>
            Get your creative juices running here!
